## Description

this my landing project, I tried my best to complete it as required.
If there is something wrong with it, I will be happy to know your feedback.

## Techniques used

- HTML: I just created a 4th section.
- CSS : I added some styling to the navigation buttons while active, also tried to make the scrolling smooth as possiple.
- Javascript:
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
- A function was added so that the nav bar will not navigate us anywhere until a link is clicked not anywhere inside the tab.

## Other features:

- I made the website responsive across all screens as per request.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section (done) and I removed the smooth scroll from CSS ... now its only done by using JS scrollIntoView() function as per request
- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting. (I tried my best).

* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures when necessary.
